### **Neit's Features**

- **Fast:**  
  Neit is a really fast programming language that transpiles to C and then uses clang to compile the C code. **We are only bottlenecked by ~~Clang~~ gcc**, though we will be looking to improve this process soon!

- **Simple:**  
  Neit is a simple language that is easy to learn and use, making it accessible to everyone.

- **Better Error Messages:**  
  Neit's error messages are better than most other programming languages, making it easier to debug and understand. We are constantly working to improve them!
- ~~**SemiGen Engine:**  
  The **SemiGen Engine** is a cutting-edge new tool in Neit that allows for the creation of custom syntax at runtime. (Still a work in progress, but already showing great potential!)~~

~~Please also check out [***syntax.md***](SYNTAX.md) for a detailed breakdown of Neit's syntax and bundled features~~

### **Development in Progress**

We are constantly working on improving Neit to make it better, faster, and more fun to use. The features we are adding aim to reduce the learning curve and make Neit the most enjoyable programming experience possible. Stay tuned for regular updates!
